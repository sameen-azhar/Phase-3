**The HCI concepts and reasons that I have considered in designing the above prototypes are as follows**

1.	I only have focused in developing the good design that is user friendly and easy to use by the customer.
2.	Firstly, I observed the task, generate the idea of how many tasks are involved in the microwave oven application.
3.	I focused on the user and tasks and identified what the real users need to perform in order to cook food in the microwave oven.
4.	I have provided connections both via WIFI and Bluetooth to the users so that they can connect to the application easily.
5.	I have provided flame ranges high, medium and low so that the user could select the one he needs while cooking.
6.	There is an option for the Degree of oven which is Centigrade or Fahrenheit.
7.	The user will have to select the type of Oven which is gas or electricity to cook food.
8.	When the food is about to cook, there is a Beep sound in the oven.
9.	I supposed that I am not the user, only a designer that has a responsibility to provide good interface to my users by providing ease in their tasks.
10.	I have managed to make controls and buttons visible and clear throughout the interface that will help the user in better understanding the functionalities of the system.
11.	The conceptual model is clear and user can choose the cooking type whatever they want to make.
12.	I provided all the necessary information in the application that the user needs.
13.	The gulf of execution and evaluation is fully satisfied and there is also a room for improvement.
14.	It wouldn’t hang or take time to process the system.
15.	 There is a clarity, user confidence and simplicity.
 
**Reasons for the rejection of prototype of design 2**
1.	Firstly, there is no availability of the WIFI, if the user has no internet connection so he will be unable to use the microwave oven.
2.	Secondly, there is no flame ranges available in the design so the user will face problem while cooking food.
3.	Thirdly, there is no degree of oven given through which the user sets the oven to gas or electricity.
4.	Most importantly, there is no beep sound in the microwave which indicates the user about their food which is about to cook.
5.	The conceptual model of the interface is not clear.
6.	User will face problems while cooking food.
